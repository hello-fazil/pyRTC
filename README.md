# PyRTC
The PyRTC is a Pythonic library that provides simplified synchronous APIs to create/manage bi-directional live streaming of Video, Audio (todo), and data between computers using the [WebRTC]([url](https://webrtc.org/)) protocol. This library is built on top of the [`aiortc`](https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc?tab=readme-ov-file), which has an `asyncio` base making it complicated to be used in synchronous codes. 

# Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hello-fazil/pyRTC
cd pyRTC
pip3 install -e .
```

> [!WARNING]  
> PyRTC is incomplete and a work-in-progress library.
