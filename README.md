# PyRTC
The PyRTC is a Pythonic library that provides simplified synchronous APIs to create/manage bi-directional live streaming of Video, Audio, and data between computers using the [WebRTC]([url](https://webrtc.org/)) protocol. This library is built on top of the [`aiortc`](https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc?tab=readme-ov-file), which has an `asyncio` base making it complicated to be used in synchronous codes.
